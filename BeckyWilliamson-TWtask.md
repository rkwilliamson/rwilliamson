# Creating a Matillion account

*Before you can use the Hub, you need to create a Matillion account and set up your Matillion profile. Follow the steps below to start using the Hub.*

## Create an account
Creating a Matillion account is simple:
1. Go to the [Hub](https://hub.matillion.com/).
2. Click the **Sign up** tab.
3. Choose how to register for your Matillion account:
    - To use your Google account, click **Sign up with Google**.
    - To use your Microsoft account, click **Sign up with Microsoft Account**.
    - To use an email address, enter your email address and create a password.
4. Click **Sign up**.
    > If you used your email address and password to create your account, you will receive a verification email. Click **Activate Account** in this email to verify your email address.  
    > If you do not receive an email, check your Spam folder. If you still have not received an email, click **Resend email** to receive a new link.

## Set up your profile
After creating your account, complete your profile:
1. Answer two brief questions to help us understand how you want to use the Hub, then click **Continue**.
    > This helps us to provide a better experience for our users.
2. Fill in your personal details and choose whether to receive emails from us, then click **Continue**.
3. Choose the region you are based in, then click **Continue**.
    > This is where your Matillion account will be created.
4. Choose the data platform you want to use in Matillion, then click **Continue**.
    > If you don't have a data platform yet, you can use the Matillion Trial Warehouse.
